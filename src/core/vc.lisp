;;; vc.lisp --- Skel version control

;; This package holds the machinery for interacting with version
;; control systems.

;;; Commentary:

;; Mercurial is our primary VCS - but we blur the lines by mirroring
;; our code to Git. In a few years mirroring will probably be
;; unnecessary but it's a really useful hack FTTB.

;; Our forge is based on an instance of Heptapod https://heptapod.net/
;; which is a GitLab fork. Most of the public repos are Mercurial, but
;; there are a few 'reverse-mirrors' which I maintain exclusively as
;; Git repos. Same goes for any fork I maintain - for example, Lust is
;; my fork of rustlang/rust and is just a Git repository.

;;  HACK 2023-09-15: hgcmd interface, parsers, metadata object protocols

;; https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/Design

;; https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/CommandServer

;; the cmdserver is the obvious solution for Skel to interact with
;; Mercurial so we'll be leaning into it right away without bothering
;; with the standard CLI. I'm unfamiliar with how this is done with
;; Git, or if it's done at all. In Mercurial's case it seems they
;; built it out of licensing issues and to avoid Python cold-start
;; penalty which aren't issues for me ATM anyway. Git is written in C
;; so doesn't suffer a cold-start hit, but it would be nice to
;; interact with repos via a similar lightweight, local, wire
;; protocol.

;; BTW It was hard to find the command to start the command server -
;; it's 'hg serve'. Here's the base shell command invoked by chg:

;; hg serve --no-profile --cmdserver chgunix --address @INITSOCKNAME --daemon-postexec chdir:/ @DIR
