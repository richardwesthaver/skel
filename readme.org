#+DESCRIPTION: project skeletons

This system provides functions and macros for building and deploying
project skeletons. /This is not a general purpose templating
system/. It is specifically for software projects which are likely
under version control, may be shared some day, and are made by me. It
looks at projects from the top down. It doesn't care about the fiddly
bits too much.
